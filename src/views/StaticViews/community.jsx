                                The primary initiative on this platform is to encourage long-term growth and self-sustainability of both the players and the site.
                                In order to best achieve this, we believe that the players should have the final say on the direction of the site.
                            </p>
                            <p style={{fontSize:'16px',paddingTop:'1%'}}>
                                As soon as we enter the second stage on our roadmap, a poll will be issued on the site, asking
                                players which game should be next and what style the game should be..
                            </p>
                            <p style={{fontSize:'16px',paddingTop:'1%'}}>

                                We will also be holding regular competitions to get the best and brightest in our community to deliver ideas they think would make great games.
                                The winners will be chosen by other players,
                                and games will be created based on these suggestions. Players who have their games developed will also be rewarded handsomely.

                                    With unprecedented speed and a clean and friendly user interface, TRX platform was by far the best
                                    choice of infrastructure from which to launch.  Utilizing the TronLink wallet, smart contracts can be executed
                                    instantly, and with the networkâ€™s user base growing, fees have almost completely disappeared.
